## Development Principles

### 1. Revenue First
Every version must improve revenue potential. If a feature doesn't help make money or retain users, it waits.

### 2. User Feedback Driven
After 1.0.0, let users tell you what to build next. Don't guess.

### 3. Technical Debt is OK
In early versions, choose speed over perfection. Refactor when revenue justifies it.

### 4. Claude Code Maximum Usage
For each version, we'll specify exactly what Claude Code should build to maximize development speed.

### 5. Launch Fast, Iterate Faster
Each version should take no more than stated time. Cut features to hit deadlines.
